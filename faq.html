            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">WHAT IS AN ESCAPE ROOM?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">An escape room is an entertaining and challenging live game experience, where you,
                as a team, must work together to solvve a mission in a closed room before time runs out. To accomplish
                this, teams need to search for hidden keys and codes, solve tricky puzzles and riddles, and generally be
                curious and thorough in their exploration of the room around them.</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">CAN I BOOK A ROOM FOR TODAY?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Due to staffing considerations, our system does not support bookings less than 24
                hours before game time. Sometimes we are able to scrounge up some personnel, however, so you can always
                try contacting us at 81 11 60 03 or through our Facebook page, and see if you're lucky!</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">WHAT OPTIONS ARE THERE FOR VERY LARGE GROUPS?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">If you need 3 or more rooms, and thus need to split into smaller groups that visit
                us at different times, then we have a unique and popular offer in cooperation with Aarhus Board Game
                Café, which is located just 200 meters from our venue. The groups that are waiting can get a table
                reserved and have fun with free board gaming (normally 30 DKK per person), while the others are in our
                escape rooms. If you'd like to hear more about this offer, please contact us at ravn@escapist.dk.</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">CAN I BRING CHILDREN?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Yes of course! If the children are younger than 13 years, we do recommend that they
                bring along at least one adult, since some of the puzzles can be difficult. Additionally, we recommend
                The Great Diamond Heist for children and beginners, since it's the more easily accessible room.</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">WHAT IS YOUR ALCOHOL POLICY?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Alcohol and escape rooms are a bad match. Guests are not allowed to bring liquids
                other than water into the room, and we reserve the right to refuse visibly intoxicated guests at the
                door, without the possibility of a refund.</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">CAN I PARK MY CAR THERE?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Yes, on both Grønnegade and Klostergade. Please do note, however, that a parking
                ticket is required most of the time. The closest car park is by Magasin department store, about 5 min
                away.</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">IS IT SCARY?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">No, none of our missions are designed to be spooky, and we have yet to experience
                customers who found the experiences frightening.</p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">WHAT IF I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">We've had thousands of guests over the years, and we've never had anyone feel
                anxious over being inside either of our rooms - not even when they suffered from claustrophobia! If you
                feel unwell, however, you're welcome to leave the room. In The Great Diamond Heist, the door is never
                locked, and USS Triton is equipped with emergency breakers on both sides of the room's electronic door.
            </p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">CAN I BUY A GIFT CARD?</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Yes, you can do that right here: buy a gift card. If you want you can buy a nice
                gift box for it too.</p>
