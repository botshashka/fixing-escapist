            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">ESCAPIST IS LOOKING FOR GAME MASTERS!</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Our new escape-room department in Tilst opens later this year, and in this
                connection we must have put together a new team of game masters. </p>

            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">JOB DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">As a game master, it is first and foremost your responsibility to ensure our guests
                an excellent experience. When they arrive, you are dressed and in a role, and not only create atmosphere
                and excitement before the game starts, but also to convey the necessary mission description, rules, and
                other meta information. While guests are on their mission, you sit at your control station and watch
                closely through cameras and microphones while controlling sound, light and various effects. After the
                game is complete, make sure to round off the experience properly so that guests have huge smiles on
                their lips as they leave the building, whether they accomplished their mission or not.
                In addition, you will also have various practical tasks, such as handling payments, cleaning, and
                tidying up the various rooms.
            </p>
            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">WORKING HOURS</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Working hours depend on bookings, and can therefore vary a lot. A shift schedule is
                made on an ongoing basis based on the employees' free wishes, and here we expect you to be available on
                average at least a couple of weekdays a week and a couple of weekends a month. If you want more work
                than this, we are flexible in terms of being able to put you on guard. The guards can be between 9 and
                22, but when fully booked all day we split it in two.</p>

            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">ABOUT YOU</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">You are passionate about making people happy, and are generally an enthusiastic and
                smiling person.
                You are outgoing and good at reading social situations so you can adapt your own behavior. Even when you
                are in costume, you are comfortable performing for strangers. You can memorize your script, but are also
                quick to improvise if something goes wrong; possibly you have previously played theater or role-playing
                games?
                You are careful and do not overlook any details when something needs to be done accurately.
                Finally, of course, it's a plus if you've already familiar with escape rooms as a game concept, have
                tried it, and love it!</p>

            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">WE OFFER</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">With the level of experiences we aim for, it will be one of the funniest jobs you
                can imagine. As these are completely new and unique missions in a newly started building, there will
                also be a good opportunity for you to put your personal touch on the game master role and the course of
                the game.
                We aim for a super cozy and informal workplace, where there is room for you to have fun with work. When
                covid-19 does not push, we love e.g. to go on escape-room excursions around the country, or hold cozy
                evenings at Aarhus Board Games Café, for which all employees have an annual pass.</p>

            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">ASSESSION</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">Our new department will open this summer, depending on when we complete the
                construction work and complete the first game tests.</p>

            <h4 class="faq_subtitle">APPLICATION</h4>
            <p class="faq_bodytext">If this sounds like something for you, send your CV and a motivated application with
                a photo to ravn@escapist.dk no later than 15 May. We will then invite you to job interviews at the end
                of May.
                We look forward to cementing Escapist as Denmark's best escape room with your help!</p>
